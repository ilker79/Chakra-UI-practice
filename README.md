# User Interface Libraries

A UI component library is a set of ready-made UI components code-blocks such as buttons, inputs, menus and so on.  Developers are able to use these different building blocks to create different components to enhance the user experience and user interface of applications.

Your task is to create a simple React app using one of three UI libraries; either Chakra UI, Ant Design UI or Semantic UI. Read the docs, plan out what you could do and the get building! 

Include the following components into your React app:

- A button
- A controlled text input
- A range input
- A switch
- An alert that is controlled by a button.
- A menu
